# Code-Your-Own-Quiz
Project from Udacity - Intro to programming Nanodegree 

Game with 3 levels and each level contains 4 or more blanks to fill in

Rubrics:

1. Immediately after running the program, user is prompted to select a difficulty level from easy / medium / hard. 
2. Once a level is selected, game displays a fill-in-the-blank and a prompt to fill in the first blank. 
3. When player guesses correctly, new prompt shows with correct answer in the previous blank and a new prompt for the next blank. 
4. When player guesses incorrectly, they are prompted to try again. 
5. Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers.
6. Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it.
7. Once initiated, the purpose of each variable is maintained throughout the program.
8. No variables override Python built-in values (for example, def).
9. Functions are used as tools to automate tasks which are likely to be repeated.
10. Functions produce the appropriate output (typically with a return statement) from the appropriate input (function parameters).
11. No functions are longer than 18 lines of code (does not include blank lines, comments, or function and variable definitions).
12. The appropriate data types are used consistently (strings for text, lists for ordered data, nested lists as appropriate).
13. Student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops appropriately (i.e. to loop through a list, for element in list:; or to test whether something is in a list, if name in list_names:).
14. Each function includes a comment which explains the intended behavior, inputs, and outputs (if applicable).
